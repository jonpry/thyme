### WebSocket handling ###

# This doesn't need @channel_session_user as the next consumer will have that,
# and we preserve message.reply_channel (which that's based on)

### Chat channel handling ###


# Channel_session_user loads the user out from the channel session and presents

# message.channel_session object without the auth fetching overhead.
